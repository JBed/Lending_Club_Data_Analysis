Analysis of the Lending Club data sets. 
===


The [Lending Club](www.lendingclub.com) (TLC) is an online lending marketplace that matches borrowers and lenders. Borrowers apply to TLC and, if accepted, their application will be listed for investors to review. Anyone with money can sign up to fund these loans.

TLC makes almost all of the data from their applicants publicly available. This included comments left my applicants regarding why they want to borrow money. This repo contains my code for exploring this data set.

### The Method

LDA posits that the collection of words that make up a document each belong to a small number of "topics". The algorithms takes an as input a set of documents and outputs the topics and the words belonging to each "topic".
